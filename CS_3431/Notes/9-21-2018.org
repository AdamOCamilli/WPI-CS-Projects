* Notes for CS 3431 (first notes with Org!) *

** Got exam back 87/100, little better than average (85)
** Prof strongly recommended we get as used to SQLDeveloper as possible

** Advanced SQL: Views (PowerPoint)
*** Views: SQL query that is registered (stored) inside a DB
**** Any query can be a view

**** Needed for: 
1. Frequent queries
2. Complex queries (simpler than global temporary tables)
3. Complex queries (written once and stored in DB)
4. Logical data independence
5. Hiding Info (infosec)

**** Base table may change, but view is still the same

**** Any code that queries the view will not change because view output is still the same

*** Can hide view but not original tables.

**** Querying a view is the exact same as querying a table
Execution DOES NOT INVOLVE CREATION OF A TEMP TABLE
Actually replaces view name with defintion (i.e. SQL code) and executes it

** SQL Developer Work:
*** Connected to SQLDeveloper for the first time 
*** Create view syntax:
create view V as
(select ... from ... where ...
UNION
 select ... from ... where ...
UNION 
 ...
 );

** Triggers
*** The constraints we looked at can be captured by Primary Key, Unique, etc.
*** When these constraints get more complex, we need triggers.
**** EX: Sum of loans taken by customer <= 100000
**** EX: Students can not take the same course after getting pass grade in it
*** Trigger: A procedure that runs automatically when a certain event occurs in DBMS
 Create [or Replace] Trigger <name>
 Before | After Insert | Update
 Delete
 [Of <attribute>]
 On <tablename>
*** Trigger Components:

**** Event: Event that activates trigger
***** Insert
***** Update
***** Delete

**** Condition (OPTIONAL): If cond is true, execute trigger
***** Before event (Trigger -> Event)
***** After event (Event -> Trigger)

**** Action (Granularities): The actions performed by the trigger
***** Row-level trigger (Execute once for each row)
****** Only use when you what you're doing (like using *)
***** Table-level trigger (Execute once for each statement)
****** Don't need to write "For Each Statement", only "For Each Row" requires it
