# WPI Projects:
  All of the computer science projects I have been a part of at WPI.
  ## My Part in the Projects
  I was the principal contributor and author of all projects listed here.
  ## Not Shown Here
  I was also a part of [a game project](https://github.com/billyzs/letterCraze) 
  for CS 3733 (Software Engineering), although I am not listed as a contributor. I mostly helped to
  write test classes using the `JUnit` testing framework, documentation, and writing the project report.

  I also have experience in `MatLab` through Math and Electrical Engineering courses.
