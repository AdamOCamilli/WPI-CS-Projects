Only interesting tests for part 1 are those for illegal input:
	        0,map,51,2
		Value must be 0 or 1 for mapping.

		0,map,10000,1
		PID and virtual address must be greater than 0 and less than 4 and 64, respectively

                0,map,0,0
		Placed page table for PID 0 into frame 0
		Mapped virtual address 0 (page 0) into physical frame 1
		0,store,11,123
		Writes are not allowed to this page

                0,load,19,NA
		Virtual address 19 has not been mapped to process 0

                0,store,10,9999999
		Value out of range

                What's up, doc?
		Please enter exactly 4 arguments for instruction. You entered 3

                0,fightme,0,1
		"fightme" is not a valid instruction

For part 2, we can test various situations that require swapping:

    	       (Assume PIDs 0,1,2 have been mapped)

	       3,map,0,1
	       Swapped frame 1 into disk at 0
	       Placed page table for PID 3 into frame 0
	       Mapped virtual address 0 (page 0) into physical frame 1

	       3,store,0,123
	       Stored value 123 at virtual address 0 (physical address 16)

	       0,store,12,321
	       Swapped frame 3 into disk at 16
	       Swapped disk offset 0 into frame 3
	       Stored value 34 at virtual address 0 (physical address 48)

	       2,load,7,NA
	       Swapped frame 2 into disk at 0
	       Swapped disk offset 16 into frame 2
	       The value 18 is virtual address 7 (physical address 39)
