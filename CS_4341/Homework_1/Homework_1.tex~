\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Problem 1.7:} To what extent are the following computer systems
  instances of artificial intelligence?
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Supermarket bar code scanners. \\~\\ 
     Upon sensing a barcode provided by a buyer or cashier they
    simply look up the barcode in a linked database. They are a good example
    of electrical engineering backed up by a very elementary DB-lookup
    program. The process of
    reading a barcode is not akin whatsoever to human sight: The bars
    are simply a way of representing numbers that can be read by a
    photoelectric cell that converts the zebra pattern into on-off
    pulses representing binary numbers. Nothing about this process is
    autonomous, let alone intelligent. Therefore, supermarket bar code
    scanners are not a good example of AI.
  \item Web search engines. \\~\\ 
    Web search engines have a number of features that can be
    interpreted as intelligent, such as use of data mining to detect
    typing errors. Every modern search engine makes
    use of machine learning and natural language
    processing as well. However, it is hard to argue that search engines themselves
    are rational agents: Their ability to ``learn'' is extremely
    specialized and not at all extendable to other classes of
    problems. Search engine design is mainly based in development of algorithms
    such as PageRank in combination with efficient DB design and
    processing power. Search
    engines do utilize many techniques from AI development and so are a much better example of AI than bar code
    scanners. But they are not autonomous and are only intelligent in
    certain very specific instances. 
  \item Voice-activated telephone menus. \\~\\
    Obviously these devices are a fantastic example of the power of
    natural language processing, considered one of the
    hardest features to implement in AI. But these devices are not
    really intelligent whatsoever: Like search engines, they are able
    to analyze certain  kinds of patterns in a way that is
    similar to human, but this ability is rooted in very specialized
    engineering that is not extendable to general pattern
    recognition. Some speech recognition systems can become attuned to
    a certain speaker's voice, but telephone voice systems are generally
    speaker-independent devices which cannot do so. As experience with
    Siri shows, however, deep learning has enabled these devices are to interact
    with humans in a dynamic and improvised manner. This represents a
    much bigger advancement than barcode scanners which simply rely on
    lookup tables, and the intelligence required can be argued to act
    rationally in a manner search engines cannot: Siri needs to string
    together sentences, a task far harder for computers than
    displaying a list. Voice-activated systems are therefore an even
    better example of AI than search engines, though they are
    definitely not a
    complete rational agent. 
  \item Internet routing algorithms that respond dynamically to the state of their network. \\~\\ 
    Although these algorithms make little to no use of natural
    language processing, they are required to act rationally in terms
    of cost-benefit analysis, to a much greater extent than search
    engines or voice processors. Routers need to accomplish several
    goals at once: The goal of being fast, the goal of transmitting
    complete and non-corrupted data, not consuming an excess amount of
    power, etc. The algorithms to dynamically work to accomplish these
    tasks are great examples of how a device acts rationally. With
    constantly varying input (network status), they are able to adjust
    how their output (packets) is delivered. Out of all the devices,
    it can be argued this is the most complete example of a rational
    agent, and therefore of AI.
  \end{itemize}
\item Do you think that the Turing test is a good way to judge a rational agent? Justify
  your answer. \\

  information is given. Time is not a problem, and you have plenty of
  space. But you must find an optimal solution.  b) Cost and heuristic
  information are given. You need to find an optimal solution and you
  want to save as much time as possible.  c) The search space is large
  and the depth of the solution is not known. No cost and no heuristic
  information are given. You need to find the shallowest solution but
  you don't have much memory/space available.
