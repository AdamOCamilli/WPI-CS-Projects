    Problem 3: 
    In this problem, you will get familiar with the mapreduce framework. 
    In this problem, please install the following python package:
        * mrjob 
    Numpy is the library for writing Python programs that run on Hadoop.
    To install mrjob using pip, you could type `pip install mrjob` in the terminal.
    Alternatively, you could install from source code:
        (1) download source code from: https://github.com/Yelp/mrjob
        (2) in the code folder, type "python setup.py install" in the terminal.
    You could test the correctness of your code by typing `nosetests test3.py` in the terminal.
