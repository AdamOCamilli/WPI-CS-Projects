def import_W(filename ='ncaa_results.csv'):
    '''
        import the matrix W of game results from a CSV file.
        In the CSV file, each line contains the result of one game. For example, (i,j) in the line represents the i-th team won, the j-th team lost in the game.
        Input:
                filename: the name of csv file, a string 
        Output: 
                W: the game result matrix, a numpy integer array of shape (n by 2)
