    Problem 1: k nearest neighbor 
    In this problem, you will implement a classification method using k nearest neighbors. 
    The main goal of this problem is to get familiar with the basic settings of classification problems. 
    KNN is a simple method for classification problems.
    You could test the correctness of your code by typing `nosetests test1.py` in the terminal.

def compute_distance(Xtrain, Xtest):
    '''
        compute the Euclidean distance between instances in a test set and a training set 
        Input:
            Xtrain: the feature matrix of the training dataset, a float python matrix of shape (n_train by p). Here n_train is the number of data instance in the training set, p is the number of features/dimensions.
            Xtest: the feature matrix of the test dataset, a float python matrix of shape (n_test by p). Here n_test is the number of data instance in the test set, p is the number of features/dimensions.
        Output:
            D: the distance between instances in Xtest and Xtrain, a float python matrix of shape (ntest, ntrain), the (i,j)-th element of D represents the Euclidean distance between the i-th instance in Xtest and j-th instance in Xtrain.

def k_nearest_neighbor(Xtrain, Ytrain, Xtest, K = 3):
    '''
        compute the labels of test data using the K nearest neighbor classifier.
        Input:
            Xtrain: the feature matrix of the training dataset, a float numpy matrix of shape (n_train by p). Here n_train is the number of data instance in the training set, p is the number of features/dimensions.
            Ytrain: the label vector of the training dataset, an integer python list of length n_train. Each element in the list represents the label of the training instance. The values can be 0, ..., or num_class-1. num_class is the number of classes in the dataset.
            Xtest: the feature matrix of the test dataset, a float python matrix of shape (n_test by p). Here n_test is the number of data instance in the test set, p is the number of features/dimensions.
            K: the number of neighbors to consider for classification.
        Output:
            Ytest: the predicted labels of test data, an integer numpy vector of length ntest.
        Note: you cannot use any existing package for KNN classifier.
